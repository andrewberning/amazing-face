# Amazing Face

This is the front end of my Amazing Face app. It detects faces in images that are uploaded to it, via the image URL, by using the face-recognition API from Clarifai.
It also keeps track of how many images you have uploaded in your account. Yes, your own login account. AMAZING RIGHT?!

## How did you build it?

I built this app using React.js for the front-end. I also used tachyons for inline styling and particles-bg for background effects.
